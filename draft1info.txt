Currently, I've gotten to adding the ambient background noises, footsteps, 
the sound of the tree breaking as the spirit wakes up and leaves it, 
and one version of the breathing sound that I'm working on.
The background sounds were pulled from a free sound website* and edited together,
as was one of the sounds for the tree breaking and one of the sounds for the
breathing. The footsteps were all made from sounds that I recorded of leaves being stepped on, 
the sound my umbrella makes when I grab it, and tapping the tip of the umbrella on my couch.
Some of the sounds I used to make the breathing came from running my finger along the back of an old CRT 
television and pushing a rubber stopper against a dresser.

For the sake of ease, I exported these smaller sounds as mp3's after mixing them so that it'd be easier
to move them around and retime in the final draft. I've also included an example of one of these sounds.
