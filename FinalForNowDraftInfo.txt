In this draft I finished adding in all the sounds I think I want to have for this narrative and getting them ordered and timed in the way that I want. I also made new sounds for the breathing and “talking” sections of the narrative. Those were made by layering multiple different sounds that I recorded on top of eachother much like how I made the walking sounds and the sound of the tree breaking.
